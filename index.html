        <p>
          I'm a Florida native and have lived in Melbourne all my life. I first became interested in
          coding after speaking with my uncle, who is a senior software architect for PayPal. As
          someone who knows me well, he suggested I look into coding and see if it interests me and
          that's how I got to where I am today. Before I starting coding I got my bachelor degree in
          organizational management but the reason for doing so was because I really didn't know
          what I wanted to do in life. I honestly wish I had started learning to code sooner but I
          am still glad I got my degree because there were still important lessons I learned and
          knowledge I gained.
