            <p>
                When it comes to my experience in coding I am like someone who has never swam before but has just put their foot in the water.
                I haven't completely dove in and only know how to swim if the pool is 3 feet deep and I have a life jacket on. So, you could say
                I am fairly new to this world. But, I have enjoyed it thus far and am looking forward to learning more. Before I starting coding
                I got my bachelor degree in organizational management but the reason for doing so was because I really didn't know what I wanted
                to do in life. I honestly wish I had started learning to code sooner but I am still glad I got my degree because there were still
                important lessons I learned and knowledge I gained.
